# WELCOME TO NOTABURGER 🍔
## Game Overview
NotABurger is a dark comedic, first-person simulation game that puts you in the shoes of an employee working at a strange and eerie restaurant. On the surface, it's just like any other fast-food restaurant, serving an assortment of unusual, plant-based and inanimate-object-inspire dishes - grass burgers, cement shakes, and more! However, beneath this quirky exterior lies a much darker secret.

As you dive deeper into the world of _NotABurger_, you'll uncover their true motives and origins. Can you survive the madness, or will you be next on the menu?

## Inspiration
The concept of _NotABurger_ was orignally developed as part of an alternate reality game (ARG) project during our college years. It started as a simple website designed based on _WhatABurger_ with our own game design ideas. The ARG quickly eveolved into a twisted narrative with puzzles, hidden games, and a dark, immersive world that captivated our class and professors.
The game you're playing today is an expansion of that original concept, blending the interactive nature of restaurant simulation with the suspense and intrigue of uncovering a dark secret. We wanted to keep the weirdness, humor and horror intact - while giving players amore hands-on experience that allows them to engage with the world of _NotABurger_ directly.
